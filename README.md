Asteroids
=
An over-engineered implementation of Asteroids. Also making use of some of [Kenny.nl](http://www.kenney.nl/)'s great art.
Note that this is not currently a running implementation of any game as it devolved into some OpenGL fiddling stuff,
although I'll try to make it into Asteroids "soon" :).
